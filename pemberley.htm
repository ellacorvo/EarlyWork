            Pemberley House
      </h2>

      <article>
         <p>Pemberley is the large and regal country estate owned by Fitzwilliam Darcy, the love interest of the main character Elizabeth Bennett. He lives alone there with his sister, Geogiana. It is located near the town of Lambton in the book, though both places are fictional.  There are several possiblities for the actual location that Austen used as a model for her descriptions, though most believe Pemberley to be inspired by Chatsworth House, near Bakewell in Derbyshire.</p>

           Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills, - and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.
