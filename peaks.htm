            The Peaks District
         
      </h2>

      <article>
         <p>The only real location in our tour, the Peaks District is an upland area in central and northern England, lying mainly in northern Derbyshire where Darcy's home of Pemberley is located. It is currently a national park, established in 1951 the Peaks District is the first designated national park in the UK.  This area is an important location in the book because it contains the home of Elizabeth's love interest, but also because it is the turning point in their relationship. Elizabeth unintentionally encounters Darcy while touring his home with her aunt and uncle on their Peaks District vacation, and discovers her affection for him during this interaction.</p>

         "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have gone - we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."</p>
