# ellacorvo.github.io

Just getting started using github! I'm using this repository as a portfolio for a few projects I've done so far. My code for these projects is all here, and I'm using Imgur to host the pictures. You can also click the links below to view the finished pages:

* [Jane Austen Location Map](http://ellacorvo.github.io/JaneAusten.html)  - A page I made using HTML and CSS concepts, using image mapping for navigation on the banner image.

* [Iceland Tours](http://ellacorvo.github.io/Iceland.htm)  - A page I made using Javascript concepts, with a form document and functions to calculate the cost of different tours.
